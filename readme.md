## Explanation about my project

Firstly, I built an html which contains a basic elements that I am going to use in js. And then, I styled them in style file. Secondly, I generated a function that fetched the movie from url. And lastly, I created function that generated html in order to dispaly the movie list in the DOM. And I called the the function that display the html at so that when the user reloads the browser they will see the movies list directly.

## The thing that I stuggled most

I found a great deal of difficulty in sorting the movie score because I didn't know that I should sort the movie list before I mapped it.

## Topic that I need more explanation
I would like to know when we should use prototype method and why should we use it please.
